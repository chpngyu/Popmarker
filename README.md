Popmarker: identifying phylogenetic markers at the population level

As phylogenomic approach become a common practice for constructing a tree reflecting true bacterial phylogeny, it has become apparent that single molecular markers such as 16s rDNA often lead to misclassification of species. In this study, we present a program: Popmarker that utilize the true species phylogeny and identify a minimum set of proteins/genes reflecting the bacterial evolution history and phylogenetic relationship at the resolution of populations. 
  Popmarker rank the proteome according to the correlation of whole species tree or sub-tree branch length against orthologous sequence distances. We demonstrate five proteins of two top ranks achieve the same resolution as concatenation of 2,203 single copy orthologous genes and the right species classification as well as correct split of the two groups of Vibrio campbellii. The top ranking genes selected by Popmarker are candidates that lead to speciation and are useful in distinguishing close related species in microbiome study.
